3. DEFINITION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST
3.1 What Is a Conflict of Interest?
A conflict of interest exists when a member of Personnel has a personal interest—financial or non-financial—that could compromise, or could reasonably appear to compromise, their ability to exercise sound professional judgment on behalf of Finance House. Conflicts may be actual (where a real conflict exists), potential (where a conflict could develop), or apparent (where a third party could reasonably perceive a conflict, even if none objectively exists).

3.2 Key Characteristics
Conflicts of interest typically involve situations where Personnel:

Could personally benefit from decisions they make in their professional capacity

Are in a position to influence company decisions that directly benefit themselves or family members

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q1: Do I need to disclose a personal investment in a publicly traded company?

A: Generally, no. If you own shares in a large, diversified public company through a mutual fund or brokerage account where you do not make specific investment decisions, disclosure is not required. However, if you personally make significant investments (over 2% ownership) in a competitor, that must be disclosed.

Q2: I have a spouse who works for one of Finance House's vendors. What do I need to do?

A: You must disclose this relationship to the Compliance Officer immediately. You will likely be required to recuse yourself from all decisions affecting that vendor, including procurement decisions, contract negotiations, and performance evaluations. A written recusal agreement will be executed.

Q3: Can I accept lunch from a client?

A: Yes, business lunches are permitted if they are reasonable in cost and purpose. A working lunch under $50 per person for business discussion is appropriate. However, you may not accept lavish meals or entertainment unrelated to business purposes.

Q4: My manager is asking me to work part-time for a company that is not a direct competitor. Do I need approval?

A: Yes. Any outside employment exceeding 10 hours per week must be disclosed to Human Resources and Compliance. You must obtain written approval before accepting. Even if the company is not a direct competitor, Finance House needs to ensure there are no conflicts and that the work does not interfere with your duties.

Q5: I discovered a client opportunity through my Finance House work. Can I pursue it on my own?

A: No, not immediately. You must disclose the opportunity to Finance House's management. Finance House has 30 days to decide whether to pursue it. You can only pursue it personally if Finance House formally declines in writing and the opportunity does not involve Finance House's clients, prospects, or confidential information.

Q6: What if I'm unsure whether something is a conflict of interest?

A: Contact the Compliance Officer immediately. It is better to disclose and ask than to incorrectly assume there is no conflict. The Compliance Officer can provide guidance on specific situations.

Q7: Are romantic relationships between coworkers prohibited?

A: No. Romantic relationships between coworkers are permitted, but they must be disclosed when they could create a conflict. Specifically, if one person supervises the other in the same reporting line, that is prohibited. If you are in a romantic relationship with someone at Finance House, contact Human Resources to determine if disclosure is required.

Q8: Can I give a gift to a client?

A: Yes, gifts valued under $100 may be given to clients if they are appropriate and business-related. Gifts exceeding $50 require pre-approval from Compliance. Prohibited gifts include cash, luxury items, tickets to major events, or travel packages.

Q9: What happens if I fail to disclose a conflict?

A: Failure to disclose may result in disciplinary action ranging from a written warning to termination, depending on the nature and severity of the undisclosed conflict. Intentional concealment of a material conflict is treated very seriously.

Q10: I want to serve on the board of a non-profit organization. Do I need approval?

A: Board service for organizations that do not compete with Finance House may be permitted if you obtain advance written approval from Compliance. The time commitment must be reasonable and must not interfere with your Finance House duties. You must disclose the board service annually.

Q11: Can I use Finance House confidential information to start my own business after I leave?

A: No. You are bound by confidentiality obligations that continue after your employment ends. Using Finance House's confidential information to compete with Finance House violates both this Policy and the law. Additionally, you are subject to a 12-month non-compete obligation with competitors.

Q12: What is the policy on cryptocurrency or alternative investments through outside organizations?

A: Any investment or financial interest must be disclosed if it involves clients, vendors, or competitors of Finance House. If the investment is personal and does not involve Finance House business relationships, it generally does not require disclosure unless it exceeds 2% ownership in an entity that competes with Finance House.

Q13: If I'm approved to manage a conflict, do I need to be reapproved each year?

A: Yes. All approved conflicts must be reassessed at least annually. You must complete an annual disclosure form each year. If circumstances change, you must notify Compliance immediately. Approval conditions may change based on organizational structure or other factors.

Q14: What if I believe I'm being retaliated against for reporting a conflict?

A: Finance House has a strict no-retaliation policy. If you believe you are being retaliated against for good-faith reporting of a violation, report this immediately to the Compliance Officer or Human Resources. Retaliation violations will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of the retaliator.

Q15: Can I appeal a decision to deny my conflict approval?

A: No formal appeal process applies to denied approvals. However, you may provide additional information or context to the Compliance Officer for reconsideration. If you believe the decision was made in error or in violation of this Policy, you may escalate the concern to the Compliance Committee.

Q16: Who should I contact if I have questions about this Policy?

A: Contact the Compliance Officer in the Compliance and Legal Department. The Compliance Officer is available to provide guidance on specific situations and to answer questions about this Policy. You may also contact Human Resources for employment-related conflict questions.

Q17: How long are conflict disclosures kept confidential?

A: Disclosures are maintained as confidential and are only shared with individuals who have a legitimate business need to know (such as your manager, HR, and relevant decision-makers). However, Finance House may be required to disclose information in response to legal process, regulatory inquiries, or internal investigations.
