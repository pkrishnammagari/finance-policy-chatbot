FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q1: How do I know my report will remain confidential?
A: Finance House uses multiple confidentiality protections, including compartmentalizing information to only essential personnel, using third-party hotline providers to maintain anonymity, and maintaining separate confidential files protected by attorney-client privilege. However, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed if disclosure is legally required. The hotline specifically provides complete anonymity where caller identification is not recorded.

Q2: What if I report through the hotline—will I ever know the outcome of my investigation?
A: Yes. Anonymous reporters can receive updates by calling the hotline again and referencing their case number, or by visiting the secure online portal. Finance House provides investigation outcomes to anonymous reporters without compromising their anonymity by using case numbers.

Q3: Can I be punished for making a false report if I was honestly mistaken?
A: No. The policy distinguishes between good-faith errors and intentionally false reports. If you report something you genuinely believed to be true based on the information available, you remain protected even if investigation proves you were mistaken. Discipline is only imposed when investigation conclusively proves you intentionally fabricated the allegation.

Q4: How long am I protected from retaliation after making a report?
A: Whistleblowers receive anti-retaliation protection for a minimum of 5 years following submission of the report. If retaliation continues beyond 5 years, courts often presume it was motivated by the original report. Protection may extend longer in circumstances involving serious violations or ongoing retaliation risks.

Q5: What if my manager tells me not to report externally to regulators?
A: Your right to report to regulatory authorities cannot be restricted. Federal law protects your right to report to the SEC, DOJ, or other agencies. Prohibiting external reporting would itself be retaliation and a violation of this policy. Consult with Legal Counsel if you receive such direction.

Q6: Can I report anonymous and later reveal my identity if I want to know the outcome?
A: Yes. Anonymous reporters who initially wish to maintain anonymity may later reveal their identity to receive more detailed updates or to participate in resolution discussions. This decision is entirely voluntary.

Q7: What happens if someone retaliates against me for reporting?
A: Report the retaliation immediately through any reporting channel. Retaliation is investigated separately and treated as seriously as the original misconduct. Substantiated retaliation can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Finance House also provides immediate interim protection measures.

Q8: Does this policy apply to contractors and vendors?
A: Yes. Contractors, consultants, and vendors are explicitly protected under this policy. They can use the same reporting channels and receive the same confidentiality and anti-retaliation protections as employees.

Q9: Can I report something that happened before this policy was implemented?
A: Yes. The policy applies to misconduct regardless of when it occurred. If you are aware of past violations, you may report them at any time. There is no statute of limitations for internal reporting under this policy.

Q10: What if my report involves the Chief Executive Officer or other senior leader?
A: Reports involving senior leadership are handled with heightened confidentiality. The Chief Compliance Officer and Legal Counsel manage such investigations independent of standard management chain. Alternative investigators may be used to avoid conflicts of interest.

Q11: How does Finance House handle reports that may involve criminal activity?
A: Finance House will cooperate fully with law enforcement and regulatory authorities investigating alleged crimes. The company does not shield employees from criminal prosecution. However, employees reporting suspected criminal activity remain protected from workplace retaliation while investigations proceed.

Q12: Can I get a copy of the investigation report if I'm the whistleblower?
A: You may request investigation findings and conclusions. Complete investigation reports may be withheld to protect privacy of other individuals and investigation methodology, but key findings and corrective actions will be shared with non-anonymous reporters.

Q13: What is the difference between a whistleblower report and a normal complaint or grievance?
A: Whistleblower reports involve alleged misconduct, legal violations, or ethical breaches. Normal complaints might involve working conditions, management style, or interpersonal conflicts not involving misconduct. Whistleblower reports receive enhanced confidentiality, anti-retaliation protection, and investigation priority.

Q14: Am I required to report something before it causes harm, or can I report after harm has occurred?
A: You may report at any time, before or after harm has occurred. The policy encourages prompt reporting but does not require it. Reports of historical misconduct are accepted and investigated.

Q15: What training do Finance House employees receive about this policy?
A: All employees receive annual training covering: (1) policy provisions and protections; (2) reporting channels and procedures; (3) anti-retaliation requirements; (4) investigation process and timelines; (5) confidentiality protections; (6) role-specific responsibilities. Managers receive additional training on escalation procedures and anti-retaliation obligations.
