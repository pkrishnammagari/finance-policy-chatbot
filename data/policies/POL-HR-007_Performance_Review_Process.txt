To provide constructive feedback on strengths and areas for development

To identify high-performing employees for advancement opportunities and recognition

To address underperformance in a timely and supportive manner

To inform compensation decisions, including salary increases and bonus allocations

To support employee career development and succession planning initiatives

To ensure equitable treatment and transparent communication across all departments and levels

1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Finance House, including permanent staff, contractors with tenure exceeding six months, and interns transitioning to permanent positions. Senior leadership and executive positions follow the same fundamental principles outlined in this policy, with adaptations as necessary for their role complexity.

Temporary employees with contracts of six months or less are exempt from the formal annual review process but may receive informal feedback as deemed appropriate by management.

2. REVIEW SCHEDULE AND FREQUENCY

4. PERFORMANCE METRICS AND CRITERIA
4.1 Performance Assessment Framework
Employee performance is evaluated across five primary dimensions, each carrying specific weight in the overall assessment:

Performance Dimension	Weight	Description

5. PERFORMANCE RATING SCALE
All employees receive a formal performance rating on an established five-point scale. Ratings are assigned based on comprehensive assessment of performance against KPIs, competencies, and behavioral criteria.

5.1 Rating Definitions and Criteria
Rating	Symbol	Definition	Performance Level	Salary Increase Range
Exceptional	E	Exceeds all expectations; consistently demonstrates exceptional performance; role model; delivers significant strategic value	Top 10-15%	8-12%
High Performer	HP	Exceeds expectations; strong performer; consistent delivery of results; recognized as valuable contributor	Top 15-20%	5-8%
Meets Expectations	M	Consistently meets expectations; performs all job functions adequately; reliable performer	Mid 50-60%	2-4%
Below Expectations	B	Below expectations in key areas; inconsistent performance; improvement required	Bottom 10-15%	0-1%
Unsatisfactory	U	Significantly below expectations; substantial gaps in performance; immediate action required	Bottom 5-10%	0%
5.2 Rating Criteria Definitions
Exceptional (E): Employee consistently exceeds all expectations and performance requirements. Demonstrates exceptional competency in all critical areas. Delivers significant strategic impact beyond defined role responsibilities. Proactively identifies and implements improvements. Demonstrates leadership behaviors regardless of formal position. Serves as mentor and role model. Handles complex situations with exceptional judgment.

High Performer (HP): Employee exceeds expectations in most areas and consistently delivers results. Demonstrates strong technical skills and competencies. Takes initiative on projects and process improvements. Collaborates effectively with team and cross-functional groups. Occasionally exceeds defined responsibilities. Reliable and trusted contributor.

Meets Expectations (M): Employee consistently meets all defined expectations and performs job functions adequately. Demonstrates satisfactory technical skills and competencies. Completes assigned work on schedule with acceptable quality. Collaborates appropriately within team. Follows processes and policies. Reliable performer who meets the requirements of the role.

Below Expectations (B): Employee's performance falls below established expectations in key areas. May meet some expectations but has notable gaps in others. Quality or timeliness concerns present. May require additional support, coaching, or structure. Does not consistently meet role requirements.

Unsatisfactory (U): Employee's performance is significantly below expectations with substantial gaps across multiple areas. Critical work quality issues, missed deadlines, or behavioral concerns. Immediate improvement required. May be precursor to performance improvement plan or termination consideration.

6. RATING DISTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
To maintain equity and prevent rating inflation across Finance House, the Human Resources Department monitors organizational rating distribution against established guidelines:

6.1 Organization-Wide Distribution Targets
Rating	Target Percentage	Acceptable Range	Rationale
Exceptional (E)	12%	8-15%	Recognition of top performers; maintained scarcity prevents inflation
High Performer (HP)	35%	30-40%	Strong performers who exceed expectations; healthy mid-upper range
Meets Expectations (M)	43%	40-50%	Solid performers meeting role requirements; largest category
Below Expectations (B)	8%	5-12%	Underperformers requiring attention; manageable intervention group
Unsatisfactory (U)	2%	0-5%	Significant underperformance; small but monitored population
6.2 Distribution Enforcement
Constraint 1: No more than 30% of the organization may receive "Exceptional" or "High Performer" ratings combined. This ensures recognition of true top performers and prevents rating inflation.

Constraint 2: Minimum 10% of the organization must receive "Below Expectations" or "Unsatisfactory" ratings. This ensures that underperformance is appropriately identified and addressed rather than inflated.

Department-Level Flexibility: Departments may vary slightly from organization-wide targets (±5%) based on actual performance distribution, but must justify variations to HR. Engineering and high-specialized departments may have higher high-performer concentrations; back-office departments may show different patterns.

6.3 Rating Normalization Process
If individual departments' proposed ratings fall outside acceptable ranges:

Department head meets with HR to review proposed ratings and supporting documentation

Ratings are discussed against specific performance evidence and metrics

Adjustments may be recommended for consistency and objectivity

Final ratings approved by HR leadership before communication to employees

Documentation of any rating changes and rationale maintained in HR records

Note: Rating normalization does not eliminate rigor or lower performance standards; it ensures consistency and prevents both inflation and undue harshness across departments.

7. SALARY INCREASES BY PERFORMANCE RATING
Salary increase recommendations are directly linked to performance ratings, ensuring that compensation decisions reflect actual performance outcomes. All salary increases are subject to budget availability and organizational financial constraints.

7.1 Salary Increase Guidelines by Rating
Performance Rating	Increase Range	Notes	Implementation
Exceptional (E)	8-12%	Top performer compensation increase; recognizes exceptional value	Effective next payroll following approval
High Performer (HP)	5-8%	Above-market increase for strong contributors	Effective next payroll following approval
Meets Expectations (M)	2-4%	Standard increase for solid performers; typically aligned with inflation	Effective next payroll following approval
Below Expectations (B)	0-1%	Minimal or no increase; contingent on improvement	May be withheld entirely; reviewed in 6 months
Unsatisfactory (U)	0%	No increase; performance improvement required before increase considered	No increase; eligible for reappraisal after PIP completion
7.2 Factors Affecting Increase Within Range
Within the assigned rating range, specific salary increase percentage is determined by:

Tenure and Market Rate: Newer employees or those significantly below market rate may receive higher end of range; senior employees near market rate may receive lower end

Budget Constraints: Organization-wide budget availability may require using lower range in constrained years

Promotion or Role Change: Employees promoted mid-year may receive additional adjustment beyond standard increase

Market Adjustment: If market analysis indicates significant lag, additional adjustment may be considered

Equity Adjustments: If prior compensation analysis identifies equity gaps, adjustment may exceed standard range

7.3 Special Circumstances
Mid-Year Promotion: Employee promoted to higher band during review year receives prorated increase based on tenure in new role, plus any standard annual increase consideration.

New Hire (First Year): First-year employees do not typically receive full percentage increase; instead, they progress through salary band based on 90-day and 6-month review outcomes.

Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): Employees on PIP do not receive increases during PIP period; increases are reconsidered upon successful PIP completion.

Extended Leave: Employees on extended leave (>3 months) during review year may have their review period extended or deferred to ensure fair assessment on adequate performance sample.

8. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN (PIP)
A Performance Improvement Plan is a structured intervention for employees who are not meeting performance expectations. The PIP provides clear expectations, support resources, and defined success criteria, while also documenting performance issues formally.

8.1 PIP Eligibility and Initiation
Triggers for PIP Consideration:

Employee receives "Below Expectations" or "Unsatisfactory" rating in formal review

Significant, documented performance issues persist despite coaching efforts

Employee fails to meet critical job requirements consistently

Behavioral or conduct violations requiring structured correction

Failure to meet agreed-upon improvement goals from previous review period

Approval Required: HR and Department Head approval required before PIP initiation. HR reviews PIP for reasonableness, achievability, and adequate resource support.

8.2 PIP Structure and Duration
Standard PIP Duration: 90 days (3 months)

PIP Components:

Clear Performance Expectations: Specific, measurable performance standards that must be met

Success Metrics: Defined metrics and evidence that will demonstrate improvement

Support and Resources: Training, mentoring, tools, or other resources provided to support improvement

Weekly Check-in Schedule: Structured 1-on-1 meetings every week (minimum 30 minutes) to assess progress

Documentation: All meetings documented; progress tracked formally

Mid-Point Review: Formal assessment at 45-day mark; early termination of PIP if impossible to meet

Final Assessment: Comprehensive evaluation at 90-day completion point

8.3 PIP Example

14. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q1: What if I disagree with my performance rating?

A: You have the right to submit a formal appeal within 14 calendar days of receiving your written review. The appeals process is described in detail in Section 12. Your appeal will be reviewed by an independent panel of HR staff and managers from outside your department. You may request a meeting to present your concerns. The panel will make a final determination within 7 calendar days. Additionally, you can add written comments to your review (up to 500 words) that become permanent part of your record.

Q2: How is my manager's rating determined? Who evaluates the managers?

A: Managers receive performance ratings using the same process as all other employees. Managers' managers conduct their reviews, and managers at Band 5 and above also receive 360-degree feedback from their direct reports, peers, and cross-functional colleagues. This provides balanced perspective on management effectiveness, not just business results.

Q3: If I'm rated "Below Expectations," does that mean I'm being fired?

A: A "Below Expectations" rating indicates your performance is not meeting job requirements and improvement is needed. It does not automatically mean termination. Typically, you will be placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) for 90 days with clear expectations, support, and weekly check-ins. Many employees successfully complete PIPs and return to acceptable performance. Termination is only considered if performance does not improve after PIP completion.

Q4: Can I request my review be done by someone other than my direct manager?

A: Your direct manager is responsible for conducting your performance review as part of their management responsibilities. However, if you have concerns about bias or conflict with your manager, you can raise these concerns with HR. HR will work with you and management to address concerns. For 360-degree feedback (Band 5+), you may suggest additional feedback providers to ensure balanced perspective.

Q5: What if I'm promoted mid-year? Do I get two salary increases?

A: Promotion and annual merit increase are treated separately. If you're promoted mid-year, you receive a promotion increase (typically 10-15%) effective on your promotion date. In the next annual review cycle, your performance in your new role is evaluated and a separate merit increase may be provided based on your performance in that role.

Q6: Can I see the 360-degree feedback comments from specific individuals?

A: Individual 360-degree feedback responses remain confidential and are not shared with you by name or comment. However, your manager receives a summary report highlighting themes and patterns from the feedback (e.g., "Strong technical skills mentioned by peers; communication in team settings could be improved"). During your review meeting, your manager will discuss these themes with you.

Q7: How often are salary increases given? Is there a cap on increases?

A: Formal salary increases are provided annually, typically during the December-January performance review cycle. The increase percentage is based on your performance rating (ranging from 0% for Unsatisfactory to 8-12% for Exceptional). These are standard merit increases tied to performance; they are separate from promotions or special adjustments. There is no stated cap on increases, but percentage increases are guided by the ranges in Section 7.

Q8: What happens if my manager leaves? Who will do my performance review?

A: If your manager departs during the review cycle, your review will be conducted by the interim manager, new manager, or (if interim coverage not immediately available) the department head or HR, with input from your departing manager if available. Performance assessment period remains the same calendar year; your review is not delayed due to management transitions. Continuity of review standards is maintained.

Q9: Do contract employees or interns receive performance reviews?

A: Contract employees with tenure exceeding 6 months receive the same performance review process as permanent employees. Interns receive informal evaluations and feedback throughout their internship. Interns transitioning to permanent positions may have an accelerated review schedule (30-day, 90-day, 6-month reviews) upon permanent conversion. Temporary employees with contracts of 6 months or less do not receive formal reviews but may receive informal feedback.

Q10: Can my performance review be used against me in disciplinary action?

A: Performance reviews are separate from disciplinary action for violations of conduct policies. However, a pattern of documented underperformance may be considered context for employment decisions. Additionally, if performance review documentation shows you failed to meet expectations, and you subsequently file a complaint or legal claim, the review may be referenced as supporting employer's decisions. This is why maintaining accurate, objective, and well-documented performance records is important for both employee and employer protection.

Q11: Who decides the specific salary increase percentage within my rating range?

A: Your manager, in consultation with HR, determines the specific percentage within your rating range based on factors including: your tenure, how your current salary compares to market rate, your prior raise history, the extent of your increase in performance over time, and overall organizational budget availability. Different employees receiving the same rating may have different percentage increases based on these individual factors. HR ensures equity and consistency across departments.

Q12: What if I performed well first half of year but poorly second half? How is my rating decided?

A: Your annual performance rating is based on your complete performance during the full calendar year. If your performance was strong in H1 but declined in H2, your overall rating will reflect this trajectory. Your manager will discuss the reason for the decline (personal circumstances, increased complexity, role misalignment, etc.) and determine whether additional support is needed, or if performance management steps are required. This may result in a "Meets Expectations" rating (if H1 strength offsets H2 decline) or lower rating if decline is significant. Mid-year check-in processes are designed to catch performance deterioration early to allow intervention before it substantially impacts annual rating.
