FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
Q1: What should I do if I see a colleague being treated disrespectfully by a manager?

A: You should report the behavior through appropriate channels. If comfortable, you can speak directly with your manager or HR. You can also report anonymously to the ethics hotline at 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Finance House takes all reports seriously and will investigate. You are protected from retaliation for making a good-faith report.

Q2: Can I accept a $150 gift from a client I frequently work with?

A: No. The gift limit is $100. You must politely decline gifts exceeding this threshold. If a client insists on giving a higher-value gift, explain Finance House policy and suggest they speak with your manager or HR if they have questions. Do not accept the gift.

Q3: My manager asked me to adjust client numbers in a report to make performance look better. What should I do?

A: This request is asking you to engage in fraud and violate Finance House policy. Do not comply with this request. Report immediately to HR, a senior manager outside your chain of command, or the ethics hotline at 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Finance House prohibits falsifying records and you are protected from retaliation for refusing and reporting.

Q4: Can I work as a consultant for a competitor in my spare time?

A: No. Outside employment with competitors is prohibited without written approval, and such approval is rarely granted. Working for a competitor would create conflicts of interest and potential risks to Finance House. If you are interested in outside work, discuss opportunities with your manager and seek approval from Compliance and Ethics Department.

Q5: Is it okay to post about Finance House on my personal social media account?

A: Personal social media use is your choice, but you must follow Finance House policies. Do not disparage Finance House, disclose confidential information, or post content that damages company reputation. Remember that personal posts identifying you as a Finance House employee may reflect on company reputation. Use good judgment and maintain professionalism.

Q6: A client is inviting me to dinner. Can I accept?

A: Yes, business meals are appropriate. Finance House policy allows meals valued under $50 per person. However, the business relationship context matters. If the meal serves a legitimate business purpose and is not excessive, it is acceptable. If you feel uncomfortable about the invitation or concerned about appropriateness, discuss with your manager.

Q7: What is the difference between a gift and an expense-covered business meal?

A: Business meals supporting work activities (client meetings, team celebrations, company events) are business expenses, not gifts. A business meal is a meal taken together for professional relationship-building. A gift is something given to someone for their personal benefit. Business meals are appropriate; gifts are subject to the $100 limit.

Q8: My family member was hired into a different department. Are there restrictions?

A: There are no restrictions if your family member works in a different department and does not report to you or have a direct reporting relationship with you. If your hiring creates a conflict (such as if later assigned to the same manager), HR will work with you to resolve it through reassignment. Family relationships alone do not prohibit employment.

Q9: Can I discuss confidential work information with my spouse or family?

A: No. Confidential business information should not be discussed with family members unless they have a legitimate business need to know and appropriate confidentiality agreements are in place. Treating confidential information casually with family members increases risks of disclosure or misuse. Err on the side of caution.

Q10: What happens if I fail a drug test?

A: Failing a drug test results in immediate termination of employment. There is no opportunity to remediate or explain. Drug testing is conducted only when there is reasonable suspicion of impairment, and a positive result indicates violation of Finance House's drug-free workplace policy. If you are struggling with substance use, seek help through the Employee Assistance Program before testing.

Q11: Can I be fired immediately or do I always get warnings first?

A: Finance House typically follows progressive discipline (warnings, written notice, suspension, termination). However, some violations are grounds for immediate termination including theft, violence, sexual harassment, illegal drug use, and serious ethical violations. Immediate termination is used for severe misconduct or criminal behavior.

Q12: How confidential is my report to the ethics hotline?

A: The ethics hotline is confidential and managed by an independent third party. Your identity can remain anonymous if you choose. However, if you provide identifying information for follow-up, the company will know who made the report. Complete anonymity may limit the investigation in some cases, as the accused has a right to know allegations. Reports are taken seriously and maintained confidentially.

Q13: What if a client gives me free event tickets worth $500?

A: You cannot accept tickets worth $500. This exceeds the $250 threshold that requires prior approval and the $100 general gift limit. Thank the client and explain that Finance House policy prohibits gifts exceeding $100 in value. Ask your manager or HR if there are circumstances that might warrant an exception.

Q14: Can I have a personal relationship with a colleague at my level?

A: Yes. Personal relationships between colleagues at the same level who do not supervise each other are permitted. You should disclose the relationship to HR to ensure there are no conflicts of interest, and the company may monitor for favoritism or conflicts. The key restriction is that romantic relationships between managers and direct reports are prohibited.

Q15: What should I do if I made a mistake and violated policy? Should I self-report?

A: Finance House values integrity and self-reporting demonstrates responsibility. If you violated policy, contact HR or your manager immediately to explain the situation. Self-reporting may result in more favorable treatment than if the violation is discovered through other means. Attempting to hide a violation or lying about it creates additional problems and escalates disciplinary consequences.
