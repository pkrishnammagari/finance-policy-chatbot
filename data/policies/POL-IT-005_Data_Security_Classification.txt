1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Finance House is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all organizational data. This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for data security, classification, and handling across all business units, departments, and operational environments. The Data Security & Classification Policy (POL-IT-005) defines how data must be classified based on sensitivity levels, the security controls required for each classification level, and the responsibilities of all personnel in maintaining data security standards.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and third-party vendors who have access to Finance House data, systems, or infrastructure. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and legal proceedings. The policy aligns with international standards including GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, and other applicable regulatory frameworks relevant to financial services operations.

3.2 DATA CLASSIFICATION DECISION TREE
Use the following decision tree to classify data appropriately:

text
START: Is this data public?
├─ YES → LEVEL 1 (Public Data)
└─ NO: Is this data intended only for internal use?
    ├─ YES: Is it sensitive (customer, financial, proprietary)?
    │   ├─ NO → LEVEL 2 (Internal Data)
    │   └─ YES: Is unauthorized access catastrophic?
    │       ├─ NO → LEVEL 3 (Confidential)
    │       └─ YES → LEVEL 4 (Highly Confidential)
    └─ NO: Is it sensitive and restricted?
        ├─ NO → LEVEL 2 (Internal Data)
        └─ YES: Is unauthorized access catastrophic?
            ├─ NO → LEVEL 3 (Confidential)
            └─ YES → LEVEL 4 (Highly Confidential)

CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA:
• Sensitivity: Is unauthorized disclosure harmful?
• Criticality: Is the data essential to operations or compliance?

14. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
Q1: What is data classification and why does it matter?
A: Data classification categorizes information based on sensitivity level, determining the security controls required to protect it. This ensures security investments focus on the most critical data and provides clear guidance on how to handle information appropriately. For example, a marketing brochure (Level 1) requires less protection than customer bank account details (Level 3).

Q2: How do I determine the classification level of data?
A: Use the decision tree in Section 3.2. Ask yourself: Is this data public? If no, is it internal only? If yes, is it sensitive? If yes to sensitivity, is unauthorized access catastrophic? Your answers lead to the appropriate classification level. When in doubt, ask your manager or Information Security Department.

Q3: What if I work with multiple classification levels?
A: Handle all data according to the highest classification level present. If you have both Level 1 and Level 3 data, apply Level 3 controls to all of it for simplicity and consistency.

Q4: Can I store Finance House data on my personal cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)?
A: No. Finance House data must be stored on company-provided systems only. Personal cloud storage is not permitted, regardless of data classification level, because controls and encryption are not guaranteed. Use company-provided file storage or contact IT for approved alternatives.

Q5: What is the password policy? Why is it so strict (14 characters)?
A: Passwords must be minimum 14 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols to withstand modern hacking attempts. Weak passwords can be cracked in minutes; strong passwords significantly increase security. The 90-day change requirement and no-reuse policy further reduce risk of compromised credentials being exploited long-term.

Q6: Can I write my password down or use the same password for multiple systems?
A: No to both. Never write passwords on sticky notes, paper, or plain text documents. Use an approved password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password) for secure storage. Use unique passwords for each system; if one system is compromised, other accounts remain secure. Reusing passwords across systems is one of the most common security mistakes.

Q7: Why is multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for admin accounts and Level 3/4 data?
A: MFA requires two forms of authentication, dramatically increasing security even if password is compromised. For critical systems and sensitive data, an attacker would need both the password AND the physical authentication device (or phone for SMS codes), making compromise extremely difficult. This is now considered standard security practice for any system handling sensitive data.

Q8: What should I do if I suspect a data breach or security incident?
A: Report immediately to the Information Security Department within 2 hours if possible, and definitely within 24 hours. Contact using the hotline number provided, or email security-incident@financehouse.com. Do not attempt to investigate yourself or clean up systems; preserve evidence for forensic investigation. Do not alert the presumed attacker if possible. Your quick reporting enables rapid incident response and minimizes damage.

Q9: I work remotely. Can I use public WiFi for work?
A: No. Public WiFi is not secure; attackers can intercept transmitted data. Always use your company-approved VPN, regardless of connection type. Alternatively, use your mobile phone's 4G/5G hotspot (with strong password and encryption enabled) or a company-provided mobile hotspot if available. Never connect to public WiFi without VPN.

Q10: What encryption is applied to email containing sensitive data?
A: For Level 3 data, TLS 1.2+ encryption is required for external emails, and use of company email encryption tools (if available) is recommended. For Level 4 data, end-to-end encryption (e.g., PGP) is required. Internal emails on the company network may use just TLS since the internal network is assumed secure. Always encrypt external emails containing any sensitive data.

Q11: How long is data retained? When is it deleted?
A: Retention varies by data type and regulatory requirements. Generally: Level 1 (business need only, typically 1-2 years); Level 2 (typically 3-7 years); Level 3 (typically 7+ years per financial regulations); Level 4 (typically 7+ years minimum, sometimes indefinite). Data is securely destroyed within 30 days of retention expiration using certified methods. Contact the Data Protection Officer for specific retention requirements for your data.

Q12: What happens if I accidentally delete or lose sensitive data?
A: Report immediately to your IT department and Information Security. Finance House maintains automated backups, and IT may be able to recover data from backups if reported quickly. The sooner you report, the better the recovery chances. Never attempt to hide data loss; delayed reporting makes recovery much harder and compounds the security risk.

Q13: Can I transfer Finance House data to a cloud service or vendor?
A: Only with documented approval from the CISO and Information Security Department. The vendor must have a signed Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or NDA. Data cannot be transferred to unauthorized countries/regions without compliance assessment. For GDPR data, specific adequacy determinations or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are required. Always obtain approval before any data transfer.

Q14: What is my responsibility if I see a colleague violating security policy?
A: Report the violation to Information Security Department or your manager. You can report anonymously if preferred. Violations create risk for the entire organization, and reporting helps maintain security. Finance House protects reporters from retaliation and maintains confidentiality where possible.

Q15: I'm leaving Finance House. What happens to my access?
A: Your access will be revoked within 24 hours of your last working day. Your company equipment will be collected and decommissioned. Your data will be transferred to appropriate colleagues or archived per retention policy. Any personal data related to your employment will be handled per GDPR data subject rights. Ensure all passwords are reset, all devices returned, and access revocation confirmed.
